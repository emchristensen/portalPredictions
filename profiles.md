### _Dipodomys merriami_ - Merriam's kangaroo rat
One of three Kangaroo Rats found at the site. In constant competition with D. ordii

### _Dipodomys ordii_ - Ord's kangaroo rat
The other regular Kangaroo Rat

### _Dipodomys spectabilis_ - banner-tailed kangaroo rat
The largest of the three kangaroo rats at the site, _D. spectabilis_ (fondly referred to as "spectabs" by those in the know) these majestic kangaroo rats are know for their striking tails. They have by far the largest feet on the site at a whopping 48 mm average and often weigh in at over 100 grams, which is nearly twice that of the other kangaroo rat weights. Spectabs were once running the show at Portal. As the site became shrubbier, however, the reign of _D. spectabilis_ came to a slow end in the 1990's. Since then, a few individuals have popped up here and there, but they haven't stuck around, often heading for grassier pastures.

### _Chaetodipus penicillatus_ - desert pocket mouse
Commonly the most abundant rodent at Portal. 

### _Chaetodipus baileyi_ - Bailey's pocket mouse
the giant version of the desert pocket mouse

### _Chaetodipus intermedius_ - rock pocket mouse
very similar to _C. penicillatus_, but rarely found at the site, perferring a rockier habitata

### _Chaetodipus hispidus_ - hispid pocket mouse
the most transient - as the Bailey's decline, will the hispids rise to take their place?

### _Chaetodipus eremicus_ - Chihuahuan pocket mouse
Do these even exist at the site? Stay tuned to find out...

### _Perognathus flavus_ - silky pocket mouse
_Perognathus flavus_ rivals only _Baiomys taylorii_ for the title of smallest rodent at our site, weighing between 5 and 10 grams. Tiny, beautiful, and immensely soft, these aptly named silky pocket mice are a favorite of previous and current research assistants alike.

### _Baiomys taylori_ - northern pygmy mouse
The other tiniest, cutest rodent

### _Sigmodon fulviventer_ - tawny-bellied cotton rat

### _Sigmodon hispidus_ - hispid cotton rat

### _Sigmodon ochorognathus_ - yellow-nosed cotton rat
the white (err...yellow-nosed) whale of the site
