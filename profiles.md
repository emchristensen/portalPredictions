### BA: _Baiomys taylori_, northern pygmy mouse
Yes, apparently southeastern Arizona counts as "northern" for this genus. One of two competitors for title of "smallest Portal rodent," _B. taylori_ is currently an infrequent but welcome visitor to the site. As it is primarily a grassland species, individuals caught on the site rarely stay for long. Interestingly, the roughly 8 grammed _B. taylori_ is actually often found in association with cotton rats (_Sigmodon_), which weight in excess of 100 grams.  
<br>

### DM: _Dipodomys merriami_, Merriam's kangaroo rat
Kangaroo rats, with their giant hind feet and namesake bipedal movement, are some of the most beloved species at the site. Of the three species in the _Dipodomys_ genus, _D. merriami_ is currently the most abundant and, presumably, dominant in the system.  
<br>

### DO: _Dipodomys ordii_, Ord's kangaroo rat
Ord's kangaroo rats are nearly indistinguishable from Merriam's kangaroo rats except for a tiny fifth toe on their hind feet that the Merriams lack. _D. ordii_ can be thought of as _D. merriami's_ kid brother who's always aspiring to be like his brother but can't quite get there; a grass-loving species, Ord's kangaroo rats are often just trailing Merriam's kangaroo rats in abundance.  
<br>

### DS: _Dipodomys spectabilis_, banner-tailed kangaroo rat
The largest of the three kangaroo rats at the site, _D. spectabilis_ (fondly referred to as "spectabs" by those in the know) are known for their striking tails. They have by far the largest feet on the site at a whopping 48 mm average and often weigh in at over 100 grams, nearly twice the size of the other kangaroo rats. Spectabs were once running the show at Portal. As the site became shrubbier, however, the reign of _D. spectabilis_ came to a slow end in the 1990's. Since then, a few individuals have popped up here and there, but they haven't stuck around, often heading for grassier pastures.  
<br>

### NA: _Neotoma albigula_, white-throated woodrat
Along with being by far the largest rodent species at the site (my, what big teeth you have...), _Neotoma albigula_ also has a big reputation---roughly 200 grams worth. Woodrats are quite different ecologically from the rest of the species at the site. Unlike the majority of our rodents which are granivorous, _N. albigula_ is primarily a foliovore; the resident woodrat in our ramada, however, seems to eat just about everything. Woodrats---also commonly known as packrats---build middens, or large nests, out of sticks and any "interesting" debris they can get their paws on. While their numbers at the site aren't prolific, research assistants know exactly which kangaroo rat exclosure plots this species tends to inhabit and secretly wish they'd brought leather gloves with them.

### OL: _Onychomys leucogaster_, northern grasshopper mouse/scorpion mouse
Amongst smammal enthusiasts such as ourselves, the carnivorous grasshopper mice are legendary. Their name(s) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohd_mSIWTXk) basically say it all. In addition to eating insects and scorpions, they have been known to eat venomous centipedes and even other mice. Both species also have a distinctive high-pitched "howl" when defending their territory. Mighty as they are, both species and _O. leucogaster_ in particular have hilariously short tails. For unknown reasons, the northern grasshopper mouse is less common at the site than the southern.  
<br>

### OT: _Onychomys torridus_, southern grasshopper mouse/scorpion mouse
Aside from overall range, the southern species differs little from the northern (_O. leucogaster_) except for a slightly longer tail and somewhat more elongated appearance. This species tends to be more abundant at the site and can be found in all plot types.  
<br>

### PB: _Chaetodipus baileyi_, Bailey's pocket mouse
Bailey's pocket mouse made its first appearance on the site in the mid-1990s. It look very similar to their congeneric relative, the desert pocket mouse (_C. penicillatus_), except about twice as big. While close in size to Merriam's and Ord's kangaroo rats, it is an inferior competitor and, therefore, is found almost solely on kangaroo rat exclosure plots.  
<br>

### PE: _Peromyscus eremicus_, cactus mouse
Often having a bold lateral orange stripe, the cactus mouse is one of the most colorful and striking mice at the site. It is also the most commonly found _Peromyscus_ species at the site, usually found in kangaroo rat exclosures and incidentally in the full removal plots. Unlike the white-footed mouse and deer mouse, however, they are more restricted to the deserts in the American Southwest and into northern Mexico.  
<br>

### PF: _Perognathus flavus_, silky pocket mouse
_Perognathus flavus_ rivals only _Baiomys taylorii_ for the title of smallest rodent at our site, weighing between 5 and 10 grams. Tiny, beautiful, and immensely soft, these aptly named silky pocket mice are a favorite of previous and current research assistants alike. Their relatively low abundance and recent rarity makes them an especially exciting catch.  
<br>

### PH: _Chaetodipus hispidus_, hispid pocket mouse
the most transient - as the Bailey's decline, will the hispids rise to take their place?
<br>

### PI: _Chaetodipus intermedius_, rock pocket mouse
very similar to _C. penicillatus_, but rarely found at the site, perferring a rockier habitat
<br>

### PL: _Peromyscus leucopus_, white-footed mouse
again, super common mouse in US, not all that common at Portal except in removal plots
<br>

### PM: _Peromyscus maniculatus_, deer mouse
a species nearly ubiquitous throughout the continental United States, though not a particularly common resident at the site
<br>

### PP: _Chaetodipus penicillatus_, desert pocket mouse
Although _C. penicillatus_ had been found at the site since the beginning of the study, it didn't become such an important player in the system until the 2000s. Now, this small pocket mouse is one of the main seasonal drivers of total rodent abundance at the site. The population explodes in the summers with known individuals, new adults, and brand new babies alike; they are ubiquitous across the site, regardless of plot type. In the winters, _C. penicillatus_ enters a type of torpor (not quite hibernation), creating a large seasonal fluctuation in abundance.  
<br>

### RF: _Reithrodontomys fulvescens_, fulvous harvest mouse
an infrequent visitor to the site; similar to the other harvest mice but slightly larger and with a distinctly longer tail
<br>

### RM: _Reithrodontomys megalotis_, western harvest mouse
the most common harvest mouse found at the site
<br>

### RO: _Reithrodontomys montanus_, plains harvest mouse
the smallest of the harvest mice, with a shorter tail and very narrow tail stripe
<br>

### SF: _Sigmodon fulviventer_, tawny-bellied cotton rat
squishy like cotton
<br>

### SH: _Sigmodon hispidus_, hispid cotton rat
squishy like cotton
<br>

### SO: _Sigmodon ochorognathus_, yellow-nosed cotton rat
_S. ochorognathus_ almost seem like an urban (erm...rural) legend nowadays. A few individuals were caught in the 1990s, but none have been seen since.

## BONUS
### CE: _Chaetodipus eremicus_, Chihuahuan pocket mouse
Back in 1996, [Lee et al.](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1382709?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference#page_scan_tab_contents) asserted that several subspecies of _C. penicillatus_ should be reclassified as separate species. One of those subspecies, _C. p. eremicus_, became known as _C. eremicus_, the Chihuahuan pocket mouse. The closest known specimen of this new species is one mountain range east of our valley. Do these exist at the site? We don't actually know. It's quite possible that the only way to tell _C. eremicus_ apart from _C. penicillatus_ is genetically, but there also might be slight differences in coloration, tail length, etc., that could be useful for identification. Stay tuned to (hopefully) find out...
