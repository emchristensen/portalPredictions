### DM (_Dipodomys merriami_) - Merriam's kangaroo rat
One of three Kangaroo Rats found at the site. In constant competition with D. ordii

### DO (_Dipodomys ordii_) - Ord's kangaroo rat
_D. ordii_ can be thought of as _D. merriami's_ kid brother who's always aspiring to be like his brother but can't quite get there--except in size. Ord's kangaroo rats are nearly indistinguishable from Merriam's kangaroo rats except for a tiny fifth toe on their hind feet that the Merriams lack. _D. 

### DS (_Dipodomys spectabilis_) - banner-tailed kangaroo rat
The largest of the three kangaroo rats at the site, _D. spectabilis_ (fondly referred to as "spectabs" by those in the know) are known for their striking tails. They have by far the largest feet on the site at a whopping 48 mm average and often weigh in at over 100 grams, nearly twice the size of the other kangaroo rats. Spectabs were once running the show at Portal. As the site became shrubbier, however, the reign of _D. spectabilis_ came to a slow end in the 1990's. Since then, a few individuals have popped up here and there, but they haven't stuck around, often heading for grassier pastures.

### _Chaetodipus penicillatus_ - desert pocket mouse
Commonly the most abundant rodent at Portal

### _Chaetodipus baileyi_ - Bailey's pocket mouse
the giant version of the desert pocket mouse

### _Chaetodipus intermedius_ - rock pocket mouse
very similar to _C. penicillatus_, but rarely found at the site, perferring a rockier habitat

### _Chaetodipus hispidus_ - hispid pocket mouse
the most transient - as the Bailey's decline, will the hispids rise to take their place?

### _Chaetodipus eremicus_ - Chihuahuan pocket mouse
Do these even exist at the site? Stay tuned to find out...

### _Perognathus flavus_ - silky pocket mouse
_Perognathus flavus_ rivals only _Baiomys taylorii_ for the title of smallest rodent at our site, weighing between 5 and 10 grams. Tiny, beautiful, and immensely soft, these aptly named silky pocket mice are a favorite of previous and current research assistants alike. Their relatively low abundance and recent rarity makes them an especially exciting catch

### _Baiomys taylori_ - northern pygmy mouse
The other tiniest, cutest rodent

### _Sigmodon fulviventer_ - tawny-bellied cotton rat

### _Sigmodon hispidus_ - hispid cotton rat

### _Sigmodon ochorognathus_ - yellow-nosed cotton rat
the white (err...yellow-nosed) whale of the site (at least for recent RAs)
